## Instruction - To Run The App
1. Open Android Studio and make sure it is able to run its default program with no errors<br>

3. Download the androidparty.jpg photo and save it into the "drawable" folder of the Android Studio project you are currently running the Birthday Card App (activity_main.xml). Doing this will elimate the error message in the activity_main.xml file with the line "android:src="@drawable/androidparty"/>". The "drawable" folder is a subfolder in the "res" folder.<br>

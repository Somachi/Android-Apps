This file contains source codes to my android apps.

## Instructions on how to run each app
1. To install android studio you need to first download and install JDK (Java Development Kit)<br>
2. Next download and install android studio
   
### 1. Installing The Java Development Kit: Windows Guide
#### i. Check If You Have Java on Your Computer
##### Open the Terminal
Before you start, you will need to open a program on your computer called the Terminal. To do this, go to the Task Bar at the bottom of your computer screen, click Start, and navigate to Run...<br>

Type cmd in the box that pops up. (Your box might look slightly different than ours, depending on what version of Windows your computer is running.)<br>

This will open the Terminal window.

##### Use the Terminal to find information
Now you are ready to check if you have the Java Developer Kit, version 7 or greater, already installed on your computer. To check if you have JDK installed (and which version), open a terminal window and type:

java -version

Then hit enter.

The example below shows Java version 8.0_05 -- the version number comes after the “1.”

(Note: As of May 2015, the most recent version was 8.0_45.)<br>

If you have Java 7 or greater, you can move on to the next node: Install Android Studio.

If the JDK is not available, or the version is lower than 7, go on to Step 2, below.

#### ii. Download the Java Development Kit
Download the Java Development Kit, aka, the JDK, from this page (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Oracle, the company that maintains Java, has a lot of options and acronyms. We're looking for the plain old JDK. This is the kit you need to start developing your apps with Java.

As of May 2015, the download icon for the JDK looked like this:<br>

After you click the download link, you'll see a list of options for download. Go to the Java SE Development Kit menu of options. Do not go to the demos and samples (the menus look very similar, so make sure to read the heading at the top).

##### Install
You've got a lot of options here, but the two you care about are the Windows options.

If your computer is only a few years old, you're most likely going to download the 64-bit option. If your computer is a little older you can follow these instructions (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/827218) to double check.

I'm going to download the 64-bit option (highlighted below).<br>

Accept the license agreement, and download it. Once you've downloaded it, go ahead and double click it to install.

#### iii: Verify that Java is Installed
Go back to Step 1 and follow the instructions to open your Terminal and verify that you have Java version 7 or higher installed.

##### Do not move on with Android Studio install until after you have installed the JDK.
Without a working copy of Java, the rest of the process will not work. If you can't get the download to work, look for error messages, and try googling to find a solution.

### 1. Installing The Java Development Kit: Mac Guide
#### i. Check If You Have Java on Your Computer
##### Open the Terminal
Before you start, you will need to open a program on your computer called the Terminal. To do this, click the search icon (magnifying glass) on the top right of your desktop, and type in "terminal."<br>
![Screen Shot 2019-12-23 at 11 14 43 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13493736/71373740-730f3800-2575-11ea-99c6-cf94d1166bcf.png)<br>
You can also navigate to the Terminal from your Applications > Utilities folder.

##### Use the Terminal to find information
Now you are ready to check if you have the Java Developer Kit, version 7 or greater, already installed. To check if you have JDK installed (and which version), open the Terminal and type:

java -version into the window, and hit enter.

The example below shows Java version 8.0 -- the version number comes after the “1.”<br>

Do not go to the demos and samples (the menus look very similar, so make sure to read the heading at the top).

##### Install
Select the JDK for your operating system (Mac OSX). In most cases, if you have a machine that is less than 4 years old, you should choose the x64 (64-bit) version (highlighted below). Search online for instructions if you have an older machine and are unsure what version to download.<br>

Accept the license agreement to download and locate the file, and double click it to begin the installation process.

#### iii: Verify that Java is Installed

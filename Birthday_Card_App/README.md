# Android-Apps
This file contains source code to my Brithday Card App app.

## Instruction - To Run The App
1. Open Android Studio and make sure it is able to run its default program with no errors<br>
2. Replace default program code in the activity_main.xml file with the activity_main.xml code here<br>
3. Download the androidparty.jpg photo and save it into the "drawable" folder of the Android Studio project you are currently running the Birthday App (activity_main.xml). Doing this will elimate the error message in the activity_main.xml file with the line "android:src="@drawable/androidparty"/>". The "drawable" folder is a subfolder in the res folder.<br>
4. Run the app (program)<br>
